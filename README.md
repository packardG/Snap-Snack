# Snap-Snack
UI Design for CS325

Steps for viewing our UI prototype:

git clone https://github.com/packardG/Snap-Snack.git

Step 1: If not already installed on your machine, install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/)


Step 2: Assuming you are using Linux/Unix, 'cd' into the project directory: `cd Snap-Snack`


Step 3: Next, install the dependencies we've used with this command: `npm install`


Step 4: Once, the install is complete, you can start the web server with this command: `node index.js`


Now you should see an output in the terminal like this:
$ Example app listening on port 8080!


Step 3: Point your browser to http://localhost:8080


Finally, you should be able to interact with Snap & Snack!!!!


Enjoy =]
