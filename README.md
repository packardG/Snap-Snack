# Snap-Snack
UI Design for CS325

Steps for viewing our UI prototype:

git clone [This repository]

Step 1: If not already installed on your machine, install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/)


Step 2: Assuming you are using Linux/Unix, 'cd' into the project directory 
	`$ cd snap_snack`
	Then, install the dependencies weâ€™ve used with this command:
	`$ npm install`
	Once done with the install process run this next command to start the web server.
	`$ node index.js`
	
Now you should see an output in the terminal like this:
$ Example app listening on port 8080!


Step 3: Point your browser to http://localhost:8080


Finally, you should be able to interact with Snap & Snack!!!!


Enjoy =]
